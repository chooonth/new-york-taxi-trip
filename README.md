## Interactive Map Visualization with Kepler GL and Streamlit

In this course, you will achieve the following goals:
- **Mastering the Kepler.gl Demo UI**: Without writing code, you will directly interact with the Kepler.gl interface and experience its various features, gaining a basic understanding of data visualization.
- **Creating Map Visualizations with Kepler.gl**: Using Google Colab, you will write code to generate map visualizations with Kepler.gl. You will learn how to extract visualization settings and use them to customize maps according to your needs.
- **Sharing Map Visualizations with Streamlit**: You will learn how to share interactive map visualizations with others using Streamlit, making it easy for users to view the maps and perform spatial analysis without any extra effort.
- **Applying Custom Map Styles with Mapbox**: You will overcome the limitations of the default map styles by applying custom map styles with Mapbox to represent geographical details more richly and accurately.
